**FPS CONTROLS INSTRUCTIONS**

FpsInput.cs -
used to allow the player to move around (Left, right, forward, backwards). Left and right are straffing motions, like most common FPS games.
This script gets attached to the actual player object that you want to move/take damage/shoot ect.

MouseLook.cs -
Used to allow the player to move the aiming of the player around in all directions. Just a common FPS style action. 
This script gets attached to the CAMERA object AND the PLAYER object. 
You must make the movement on the PLAYER object horizontal only and the movement on the CAMERA object VERTICAL only.
This is so that the gravity effect in the FpsInput.cs script that pushes down on the player to keep them from floating 
does not cause them to get pushed opposite of the direction they are looking.
